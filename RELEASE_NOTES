         - branch out from R1.2.0 to support PCIe TPR
         - implement complementary trigger
         - add cpsw_try_catch() to specify the exact location when error occurrs
         - make dynamic path and channel number allocation to support both ATCA and PCIe
         - improve report function to specify bus type (ATCA or PCIe)


R1.2.0      Mar 1, 2021   Kukhee Kim
         merge ued_support branch
         - support timing-core submodule v3.2.2 and later


ued_support  May 20, 2002 Kukhee Kim (khkim)
     branch out from R1.1.0 to support UED mode
     - using LCLS1 clock rate, but using LCLS2 timing decoding
     - need to set up clock rate and decoding independantly
       . add new API: SetModeSel - (timing decoding: 0: LCLS1 style, 1: LCLS2 style)
                      SetModeSelEn - (0: backward compatible, using ClkSel, 1: new mode, ClkSel and ModeSel are independent)

R1.0.1      April 20, 2018     Kukhee Kim (KHKIM)
     remove force setting for msgNoDelay (LCLS1 timing pattern), and force tag to R1.0.1

R1.0.1      April 11, 2018     Kukhee Kim (KHKIM)
     Remove default setting for crossbar switch
     Assume crossbarControl module will setup the crossbar switch properly

R1.0.0      March 23, 2018     T. Straumann
    
    use cpsw framework R3.6.4

R1.0.0      March 21, 2018     Kukhee Kim (KHKIM)
    
    use cpsw framework R3.6.3

    Merge Till's branch 'ts_fixed_warnings'

    Fixed (harmless) compiler warnings
    Changed arg to TprPatternYaml::Read() from uint8_t* to TprStream*
    Must add to, not replace the CXXFLAGS (optimization was lost)
    Fixed #pragma(back) -> #pragma(pop)
    buf fix for pragma pack (pop)
    Fixed compiler warnings


Feb 27, 2018   Prepare Initial Release
